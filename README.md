# CPIT210 Course Project
Introduction about your project, describe the problem, and your solution. Project truth tables, expressions, k-maps and any related task must included here. Also project documentation must included.

In this project students should work in groups of 3 to implement a fully functioning sequential circuit. This sequential circuit should work as a Buffer, a competition circuit, or 4-way light circuit depending on the student's choice. The idea of the three projects will be explained in the lab. To design the circuit, Logisim should be used. Students should submit their software implementation and the report here.

### Buffer
#### Problem Statement
This circuit solves the reading and writing to buffer. For example: If we have input 4, we want to write it, buffer works like memory and stores it there when we click the write button. In case when we want to read from the buffer, by pressing read button, it starts reading from the first entry sored in the buffer. Buffer is nothing but a temporary memory. In addition, we can clear the contents from the buffer. Students are asked to design, and implement the required circuit.

And now the last part, we have added an nand gate and connect it with the above
 nand and also connect it with an and in the start of the circ , we also added an 
and gate and connect it with the  two nands that we have, and we added a not 
gate from the down nand and connect It with an and that is under the  second  d flip flop,
and from the third d flip flop we connect it with the middle and , now 
every thing is good we just have to add the ram and connect the address with the 
multiplixer and connect the ‘sel’ with the last OR gate and connect the id with the 
multiplixer and connect the ‘cir’ with the clear and finally we connect the ram 
with the last AND gate, last thing we have to do is adding the 4 data inputs and 
connect them with a splitter and connect it to the ram, after we finish that we will 
add the hex digit display and connect it with the ram

We know that there are some mistakes in our circuit but I think 90% of it is right ,
we have tried every thing we can do to make the circuit right but we ran out of time due to the exams and other projects
