#Third part

And now the last part, we have added an nand gate and connect it with the above
 nand and also connect it with an and in the start of the circ , we also added an 
and gate and connect it with the  two nands that we have, and we added a not 
gate from the down nand and connect It with an and that is under the  second   
 d flip flop,and from the third d flip flop we connect it with the middle AND gate , now 
every thing is good we just have to add the ram and connect the address with the 
multiplixer and connect the ‘sel’ with the last OR gate and connect the ID with the 
multiplixer and connect the ‘cir’ with the clear and finally we connect the ram 
with the last AND gate, last thing we have to do is adding the 4 data inputs and 
connect them with a splitter and connect it to the ram, after we finish that we will 
add the hex digit display and connect it with the ram

We know that there are some mistakes in our circuit but I think 90% of it is right ,
we have tried every thing we can do to make the circuit right but we ran out of time due to the exams and other projects
